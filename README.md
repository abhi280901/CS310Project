Generative-AI creating Mechanics and Context for Turn-based Strategy Card Games


Turn-based strategy card games offer players engaging gameplay through strategic decision-making and resource management. However, designing diverse and balanced game mechanics, as well as creating compelling contextual elements, can be a challenging and time-consuming task for game developers. Moreover, generated content can become repetitive or imbalanced, leading to player disengagement. This research explores the application of generative AI techniques to automate the generation of mechanics and context for turn-based strategy games. By training AI models on existing game mechanics and contextual elements, this study aims to develop a system that can dynamically generate novel and balanced mechanics, objectives, and content. The proposed generative AI system holds promise for reducing development time, increasing gameplay variety, and enhancing player experiences. The research includes an investigation of suitable generative AI algorithms, evaluation of generated content, and integration of the system into a prototypical turn-based strategy game. The findings from this study would contribute to the growing field of procedural content generation and demonstrate the potential of generative AI in revolutionizing game design for turn-based strategy games. The AI envisioned in this project is designed to generate mechanics and context for a game, and is not an AI designed to play a game.
